  ## Description
  A back-end application that allows you to interact with a database by using url-based API that will go through specific routes based on different parameters and other requests.  This is not a deployed application, but serves more as a proof of concept on how social networks would behave.
  
  ## Usage
  To use the applicaiton you can clone the repository.  Once cloned, you will needs Node.js installed as well to run the commands in the CLI, (Command Line Inteface), of your console's terminal along with MongoDB to create the database to hold the data.  To start the application you can run `node index.js` or `npm run start` in the console and it will automatically seed your database with sample data. A link to the demo video can be found in the `Links` section with the tab `Demo`.
